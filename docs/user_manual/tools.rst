.. note:: A Python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9).

    Python does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. Python is a case sensitive programming language. Thus, *Manpower* and *manpower* are two different identifiers in Python.
