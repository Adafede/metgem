Starting |appname|
==================

When you start |appname| for the first time there will be no window open by default.
You will be greeted by a welcome screen, which will have option to create a new project from MS/MS data or open an existing project.

The first step will be to import data from the :menuselection:`File --> Import spectra list` menu or by clicking on :guilabel:`Import Data`  under start section of the welcome screen. This will open the :ref:`import data file <import_data>` dialog box. If you
want to open an existing project, either use :menuselection:`File --> Open Project...` or drag the image from your computer into |appname|'s window.

Saving and opening files
------------------------

Now, once you have figured out import data, you may want to
save it. The save option is in the same place as it is in all other computer
programs: the top-menu of :guilabel:`File`, and then :guilabel:`Save`. Select
the folder you want to have your drawing, and select the file format you want
to use (``.mnz`` is |appname|'s default format, and will save everything). And then
hit :guilabel:`Save`.

Check out :ref:`overview` for further basic information,
:ref:`general_concepts` for an introduction on concepts |appname| is built on, or just go out and explore |appname|!
