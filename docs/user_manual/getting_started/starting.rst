Starting |appname|
==================

When you start |appname| for the first time there will be no window open by default.
You will be greeted by a welcome screen, which will have option to create a new project from MS/MS data or open an existing project.
The first step will be to import data from the :guilabel`File --> 
To create a new canvas you have to create a new document from the File menu or by clicking on New File under start section of the welcome screen. This will open the new file dialog box. If you want to open an existing image, either use File ‣ Open or drag the image from your computer into Krita’s window.
